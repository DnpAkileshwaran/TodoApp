# TODO APP

Simple Todo App built using mern stack. The tech's used are:

  - React js
  - MondoDb
  - Express
  - Node.js

# New Features!

  - Display remaining todos and todos to be done
  - Enabled DeleteAll feature

### Installation

This App requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.
Since I've used mongoDb installed in local, you must have your [mongoDb](https://mongodb.com/) installed on your system

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd TodoApp
$ npm install -d
$ node run dev
```
